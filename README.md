## zkSNARK Circuit Project 

## Overview
This project involves the development and testing of a zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) circuit. zk-SNARKs enable the verification of computations without revealing any underlying data, enhancing privacy and security. This project utilizes Circom for circuit design and Hardhat with the hardhat-circom plugin for seamless integration of zk-SNARK circuit compilation, proof generation, and verifier contract deployment.

## Tools Used
- **Circom**: For designing zk-SNARK circuits.
- **Hardhat and hardhat-circom plugin**: Facilitates compilation of Circom circuits, generation of zk-SNARK proofs, and interaction with Ethereum-based networks.
- **Solidity**: Used to write the Ethereum smart contract that acts as the verifier.
- **Sepolia/Mumbai Testnet**: Networks for deploying the verifier contract and executing transactions.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat
- An Ethereum wallet with Sepolia or Mumbai testnet ETH

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your Ethereum wallet and testnet details:
   ```plaintext
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
   ```

## Project Execution Steps

### Step 1: Write the zk-SNARK Circuit
- **Create the Circuit (`circuit.circom`)**  
  Design a zk-SNARK circuit that can process specified inputs and generate proofs without revealing the inputs themselves.

### Step 2: Compile the Circuit
- **Compile with Hardhat**
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile-circom
  ```
  This command will compile the Circom circuit and generate the necessary artifacts for proof generation.

### Step 3: Generate a zk-SNARK Proof
- **Generate Proof**
  ```bash
  npx hardhat generate-proof --input '{"A": 0, "B": 1}'
  ```
  This uses the inputs A=0 and B=1 to generate a zero-knowledge proof.

### Step 4: Deploy the Verifier Contract
- **Deploy to Testnet**
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deployVerifier.js
  ```
  Replace `sepolia` with `mumbai` if using the Mumbai testnet instead.

### Step 5: Verify the Proof
- **Verify Proof on Blockchain**
Ensure the `verifyProof()` method returns true, confirming the validity of the zk-SNARK proof.

## Usage

Follow the steps under "Project Execution Steps" to fully execute the zk-SNARK circuit, from compilation through verification on a testnet.
